\maketitle


For this week my partner was Lucas. I was mainly responsible for typing out the code and debugging the code. I also was responsible for making sure Lucas was able to access the code we had discussed, which I handled by making a GitHub repository and sharing the code via cloud. I also had a bit of input on circuit design, but Lucas was mainly responsible for the design and construction of the circuits.


For the exercises, Bryce marked us off as completing them.
